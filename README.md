# PIZIBOT

**PIZIBOT** is a ROS 2 package for a two-wheeled mobile robot designed for navigation and computer vision. The project is in its very early stages, and no functionality has been developed yet.

## Project Status

Currently, this project is in the planning phase, and the initial setup for robot description and basic control systems is being worked on. No functionalities such as motor control, navigation, or computer vision have been implemented yet.

## Planned Features

- **General Robot Management**:
  - **Battery Management**: Implement monitoring and management of battery levels, with automated alerts for low battery.
  - **LCD Display Integration**: Set up a 16x2 LCD display for real-time robot status information (battery level, connection status, etc.).
- **Motor Control**: Implement low-level motor control for the robot's differential drive system.
- **Sensor Integration**: Add support for LIDAR, cameras, and other sensors for environmental awareness.
- **SLAM**: Add support for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping.
- **Navigation**: Integrate ROS 2 Navigation (Nav2) for autonomous movement and path planning.
- **Computer Vision**: Implement object detection and tracking capabilities using onboard cameras.
- **Web Interface**: Create a web server to allow remote interaction with the robot via a browser. This interface will allow control, monitoring, and diagnostics of the robot.

## Getting Started

This repository is still under development, and no runnable code or launch files are available at the moment. Future instructions for setting up and running the robot will be provided as the development progresses.
